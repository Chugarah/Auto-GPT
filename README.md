Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by GPT-4, autonomously develops and manages businesses to increase net worth. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

<h2 align="center"> 💖 Help Fund Auto-GPT's Development 💖</h2>
<p align="center">
If you can spare a coffee, you can help to cover the API costs of developing Auto-GPT and help push the boundaries of fully autonomous AI!
A full day of development can easily cost as much as $20 in API costs, which for a free project is quite limiting.
Your support is greatly appreciated

## 💾 Installation

To install Auto-GPT, follow these steps:
Basic steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  For this step you need Git installed, but you can just download the zip file instead by clicking the button at the top of this page ☝️
  
    ```Bash
    git clone https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  *(Type this into your CMD window, you're aiming to navigate the CMD window to the repository you just downloaded)*

    ```Bash
    cd 'Auto-GPT'
    ```

### Native Installation

1. Make sure you have all the **requirements** above, if not, install/get them.
*The following commands should be executed in a CMD, Bash or Powershell window. To do this, go to a folder on your computer, click in the folder path at the top and type CMD, then press enter.*

2. Install the required dependencies:
*(Again, type this into your CMD window)*

    ```Bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Rename `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. If you plan to use Speech Mode, fill in your `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY` as well.

   - Obtain your OpenAI API key from: <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys>.
   - Obtain your ElevenLabs API key from: <https://elevenlabs.io>. You can view your xi-api-key using the "Profile" tab on the website.
   - If you want to use GPT on an Azure instance, set `USE_AZURE` to `True` and provide the `OPENAI_API_BASE`, `OPENAI_API_VERSION` and `OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID` values as explained here: <https://pypi.org/project/openai/> in the `Microsoft Azure Endpoints` section

### Docker Installation

Do the following steps to run Auto-GPT in a Docker container:

1. Be sure to have run Installation steps and have a `.env` file in the root directory filled with data from step 3 under Naive Installation.
2. Don't forget to change your config.py file to match your needs.
3. In your project folder, run the following command:

    ```Bash
    # To build the docker image
    docker-compose build
    ```

4. Running Our Container

    ```Bash
    # Enter the container Auto-GPT -- With a speaker
    docker-compose run --rm --name Assistant1 auto-gpt
      ```

    4.1 To enable Docker with sound you need to run the following command:

      ```Bash
      # With Speaker
      docker-compose run --rm --name Assistant1 auto-gpt python main.py --speak
      ```

5. Shutdown & Restart

    ```Bash
    # To shutdown the container &
    docker-compose down
    
    # To remove all stopped containers:
    docker container prune

   # To remove all unused images
    docker image prune

    # WARNING- THIS WILL DELETE VOLUMES
    docker volume prune
      ```

## 🔧 Usage

### Preparing Environment

We need to do some manual setup before we can run the program.

1. Open config.py. Find self.use.azure and set it to false incase you are not using Azure

   ```python
   self.use_azure = os.getenv("USE_AZURE") == 'False'
   ```

2. To able to use config.yaml to feed Auto-GPT with starting data you need to change
this line  SAVE_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'config.yaml') in script/ai_config.py.

      ```python
      # From this
      SAVE_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', os.getenv("CONFIG_YAM_FILE"))

      # To this
      SAVE_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '', os.getenv("CONFIG_YAM_FILE"))
      ```

### Activating python script

1. Run the `main.py` Python script in your terminal:
*(Type this into your CMD window)*

    ```Bash
    python scripts/main.py
    ```

2. After each of AUTO-GPT's actions, type "NEXT COMMAND" to authorise them to continue.
3. To exit the program, type "exit" and press Enter.

## 🗣️ Speech Mode

Use this to use TTS for Auto-GPT

```Bash
python scripts/main.py --speak
```

## 🔍 Google API Keys Configuration

This section is optional, use the official google api if you are having issues with error 429 when running google search.
To use the `google_official_search` command, you need to set up your Google API keys in your environment variables.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. If you don't already have an account, create one and log in.
3. Create a new project by clicking on the "Select a Project" dropdown at the top of the page and clicking "New Project". Give it a name and click "Create".
4. Go to the [APIs & Services Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) and click "Enable APIs and Services". Search for "Custom Search API" and click on it, then click "Enable".
5. Go to the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page and click "Create Credentials". Choose "API Key".
6. Copy the API key and set it as an environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY` on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.
7. Go to the [Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) page and click "Add".
8. Set up your search engine by following the prompts. You can choose to search the entire web or specific sites.
9. Once you've created your search engine, click on "Control Panel" and then "Basics". Copy the "Search engine ID" and set it as an environment variable named `CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.

### Setting up environment variables

   For Windows Users:

```Bash
setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
setx CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID "YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"

```

For macOS and Linux users:

```Bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
export CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"

```

## Redis Setup

Install docker desktop.

Run:

```Bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

See <https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server> for setting a password and additional configuration.

Set the following environment variables:

```Bash
MEMORY_BACKEND=redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

Note that this is not intended to be run facing the internet and is not secure, do not expose redis to the internet without a password or at all really.

You can optionally set

```Bash
WIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False
```

To persist memory stored in Redis.

You can specify the memory index for redis using the following:

````Bash
MEMORY_INDEX=whatever
````

## 🌲 Pinecone API Key Setup

Pinecone enables the storage of vast amounts of vector-based memory, allowing for only relevant memories to be loaded for the agent at any given time.

1. Go to app.pinecone.io and make an account if you don't already have one.
2. Choose the `Starter` plan to avoid being charged.
3. Find your API key and region under the default project in the left sidebar.

### Setting up environment variables

   For Windows Users:

```
setx PINECONE_API_KEY "YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
export PINECONE_ENV="Your pinecone region" # something like: us-east4-gcp

```

For macOS and Linux users:

```
export PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
export PINECONE_ENV="Your pinecone region" # something like: us-east4-gcp

```

Or you can set them in the `.env` file.

## View Memory Usage

1. View memory usage by using the `--debug` flag :)

## 💀 Continuous Mode ⚠️

Run the AI **without** user authorisation, 100% automated.
Continuous mode is not recommended.
It is potentially dangerous and may cause your AI to run forever or carry out actions you would not usually authorise.
Use at your own risk.

1. Run the `main.py` Python script in your terminal:

```
python scripts/main.py --continuous

```

2. To exit the program, press Ctrl + C

## GPT3.5 ONLY Mode

If you don't have access to the GPT4 api, this mode will allow you to use Auto-GPT!

```
python scripts/main.py --gpt3only
```

## 🖼 Image Generation

By default, Auto-GPT uses DALL-e for image generation. To use Stable Diffusion, a [HuggingFace API Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) is required.

Once you have a token, set these variables in your `.env`:

```
IMAGE_PROVIDER=sd
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

This experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

1. Not a polished application or product, just an experiment
2. May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!
3. Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!

## Development

This step will set you up to develope and improve the code. If you just want to run the program, skip this step.

### Windows Conda

This requires you have installed Conda and activated an environment..
We also need to use an software to write code with debugger. I recommend using Visual Studio Code. This also required that you have connected your debugger to your conda environment.

This also require that you have an running docker with redis stack.

1. Lets install some packages that we will need.

   ```Bash
   conda install -c conda-forge orjson
   ```

2. Uncomment Docker import # import docker in executor.py
3. Start your docker stack with redis stack

    ```Bash
    docker-compose run --rm --name Assistant1 auto-gpt python main.py --speaker
    ```
